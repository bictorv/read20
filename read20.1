.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Read20
reads tapes produced by the TOPS-20 backup and archival program
.IR DUMPER ,
producing directory listings and extracting files.
The
.B \-t
option specifies a directory listing,
and the
.B \-x
option specifies extraction.  Both actions can be specified.
.PP
If no
.IR string ,
.IR \-e ,
.BR \-F ,
or
.B \-S
option is given, every file on the tape
is processed.  Otherwise, every file with a name that either
contains \fIstring ...\fR, matches (as in ed(1)) the regular expression
.IR expression ,
or is selected by the
.B \-S
and
.B \-F
options will be processed.
The last two options are used to select files by saveset number
and file number.  This is useful when extracting from an archive tape.
The most-recently specified saveset number is associated with the
specified file numbers.
The TOPS-20 filenames are lowercased before any matching.
Note that \fIstring\fR is
.B not
a generalized
pattern, but is just a simple string that is matched against all the characters
in the filenames.  Special characters (such as '\<' and '\>') must
be quoted to get past the shell.
.PP
The UNIX filename of an extracted file is generated from the
TOPS-20 filename by stripping off the device name, translating
the TOPS-20 directory syntax to a relative directory in UNIX format,
and stripping off the generation number, unless the
.B \-g
flag is given.
Directories will be built as needed with protection 775,
but any existing directory or its contents will not be changed
(unless an extracted file replaces one of the same name).
.PP
The directory listing prints out for every file
.IP
-- a ``flags'' field which indicates if the file is archived (A),
offline (O), or invisible (I)
.br
-- the size in TOPS-20 pages (for offline files the size before archiving)
.br
-- the number of bytes in the file
.br
-- the \fIbytesize\fR (number of bits per byte) of the file
.br
-- the octal TOPS-20 file protection
.br
-- the time and date the file was last modified
.br
-- the full pathname of the file.
.PP
If the
.B \-v
flag is given, two additional fields are printed at the left:
.br
-- the saveset number
.br
-- the file number
.PP
.I Read20
only extracts text files and 8-bit files.
In text files, unless the
.B \-c
flag is given, carriage returns preceding linefeeds are removed.
The file length as printed by the `t' option is not
adjusted to account for this.
.I Read20
decides whether or not a file is text by examining the
\fIbytesize\fR of the file.  If the file has 7-bit bytes, it is assumed to
be a text file.  If it has 8-bit bytes, it is extracted
at 4 bytes/word, including null bytes.
If the file has any other
.IR bytesize ,
requests to extract it are ignored.
.PP
Occasionally, text files have a \fIbytesize\fR of 36 or 0 instead of the proper
\fIbytesize\fR of 7.
The \-T flag forces these files to be considered as text files.
.PP
Alternate tape devices or files may be specified with the
.B \-f
flag.  The special filename `\-' signifies the standard input.
.PP
On non-Berkeley Unix systems, name collisions can occur
when the first 14 characters of extracted files are
the same.  If this is the case, use the
.B \-n <number>
option.  This will cause
the Unix filenames to be numeric, starting with the number following the
.BR \-n .
The mapping from the original TOPS-20 to the numeric Unix filenames
is written to the file
.I `` Logfile ''
in the current directory.
.SH FILES
/dev/rmt8 - default tapefile.

.SH BUGS
Files which span tape boundaries are handled poorly.  To extract
such a file, extract each piece and then combine the files under
UNIX.

Directory descriptor blocks on the tape are not interpreted.

Offline files usually show up in directory listings with a zero
.IR bytesize .
