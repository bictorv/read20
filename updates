Subject: read20 hackery
Status: RO

I put a new version of read20 out there, currently called Nread20.
Some portions haven't been well tested since I didn't have
an actual tape to spin, just a 3 MB extract-- let me know of funnies.
Grant, would you test the null extraction on your files?

There are these changes:
1. Build directories on the fly and extract into them.
    Currently directory protections are arbitrarily set to 775.
2. Allow embedded nulls in text files.
3. Select by saveset and file numbers (for future archive retrievals).
    When listing, the saveset number and filenumber are printed on left
    if -v (verbose) is on.
4. Warn about partial files (those split across tapes).  Only warn on
    extract, not on listing, unfortunately.
(5. An earlier change: -g keeps generation numbers.)

Note that with change (1) it is now impossible to extract a file into
the current directory.

Syntax for (3) is
    [-S savesetnum] -F filenums....  [-S ssnum -F filenums...] ....
savesetnum defaults to 0.  All three types of selection (pattern,
regular expression, and ss/filenum pairs can be specified at once.

Man page is not yet updated.
