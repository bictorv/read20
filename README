The file "updates" contains a msg which talks about some recent changes,
but it needs a correction or two: the man page has mostly been updated
(but it's ugly and needs re-writing), and although I haven't explicitly
tested the new code as carefully as I'd like (yet), it's run for quite
awhile w/o problems.

Let me know of any bugs or fixes or improvements you make.
The big one we never figured out is where the archive info is stored:
the obvious stuff (the test code is still there) doesn't work.
I've included the RCS file for your hacking and amusement.
